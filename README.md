This project demonstrates how to automate interactions with Google Forms using Java and Selenium WebDriver. It provides a framework for automating form submissions, including filling out text fields, selecting options from dropdown menus, clicking radio buttons, and submitting the form.

Functionality Implemented
Fill Text Fields: Automatically populate text fields with predefined values.
Select Dropdown Options: Choose options from dropdown menus based on specified criteria.
Click Radio Buttons: Automatically select radio buttons based on predefined conditions.
Submit Form: Automatically submit the form after filling out all necessary fields.
How to Execute the Application
Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Selenium WebDriver
WebDriver-compatible browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox)
IDE for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
Installation
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
Set up your Java development environment and import the project into your IDE.
Running the Application
Open the project in your IDE.
Run the test case method (testCase01() in this case) from the test class.
Ensure that the WebDriver instance is properly configured to use your preferred browser.
Watch as the automation script fills out the Google Form according to the specified instructions.
After execution, verify that the form submission was successful and inspect any response messages.
Additional Information
Dependencies: This project relies on Selenium WebDriver for browser automation. Ensure that you have the appropriate WebDriver executable (e.g., chromedriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox) available in your system PATH or specify its location in your project configuration.
Customization: Feel free to customize the test case methods and wrapper functions to suit your specific use case or form structure.
